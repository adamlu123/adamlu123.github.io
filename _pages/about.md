I am a senior researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond working on efficient pre/post-training methodologies of large vision-language models. Before that I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at UC Irvine (advisor: [Pierre Baldi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RhFhIIgAAAAJ&hl=en)).

Check out our recent work on computer use agent [OmniParser](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser) (Been #1 Trending repo on GitHub and HuggingFace model hub, 22k+ star), and [scaling synthetic trajectory data generation for web agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
